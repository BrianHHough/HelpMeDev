# HelpMeDev
2021 ETHGlobal Hackathon Project

**Description:** Think of all the side projects you have worked on and maybe put it to the side or never finished because of a technical snag or a frustrating bug. What if you could put out contracts to an ecosystem of other developers to help you finish your project or feature for you. HelpMeDev is a gitcoin for personal projects (i.e. creating contracts so you can pay developers to help you finish your side project, startup, dream app, etc.)

**Tech Stack:**
- Front-End: React
- Auth + Backend: Moralis & Metamask
- Elastic Sidechain: SKALE
- Blockchain: Ethereum
- Deployment: Netlify + SkyNet

**Tools:**
- Ethereum Endpoint: Alchemy
- Smart Contract Functionality: OpenZeppelin
- Local Testing: Ganache
- Testing: Hardhat

**UX:**
- Amazon marketplace / Fiverr ecosystem of contracts of people looking to hire work
- Prospective dev searches the marketplace....sees work...
- 1. Sign up to do it - the contract issuer agrees to accept you or compares you to other bids
- 2. Counter-bid - provide an offer that's higher/lower, more/less hours
- NDA or contract to contribute code or work on project(?) - "I agree to give code to the buyer"
- You agree to a timeline with milestones
- Work commences
- Work is delivered (if there are delays, then it eats up at final milestone; if you complete it sooner, bonus(?))
- Review system for contract owner and dev

**Action Items:**
- UI/UX designs and walkthrough of app (Figma)
- Front-End (React)
- API/Data Layer (Moralis)
- Back-End (Serverless)
- Blockchain (Solidity <> Skale IMA-SDK)
- Testing Prototype (Hardhat)
- Final Presentation with slides

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
