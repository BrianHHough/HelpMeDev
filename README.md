# HelpMeDev
2021 ETHGlobal Hackathon Project

**Description:** Think of all the side projects you have worked on and maybe put it to the side or never finished because of a technical snag or a frustrating bug. What if you could put out contracts to an ecosystem of other developers to help you finish your project or feature for you. HelpMeDev is a gitcoin for personal projects (i.e. creating contracts so you can pay developers to help you finish your side project, startup, dream app, etc.)

**Participants:**
- Brian Hough
- Saudagar Barde

**Tech Stack:**
- Front-End: React
- API layer: GraphQL
- Blockchain: Solidity (ETH)
- Back-End: NodeJS

**Tools:**
- Ganache
- OpenZeppelin
- Infura

**UX:**
- Amazon marketplace / Fiverr ecosystem of contracts of people looking to hire work
- Prospective dev searches the marketplace....sees work...
- 1. Sign up to do it - the contract issuer agrees to accept you or compares you to other bids
- 2. Counter-bid - provide an offer that's higher/lower, more/less hours
- NDA or contract to contribute code or work on project(?) - "I agree to give code to the buyer"
- You agree to a timeline with milestones
- Work commences
- Work is delivered (if there are delays, then it eats up at final milestone; if you complete it sooner, bonus(?))
- Review system for contract owner and dev
