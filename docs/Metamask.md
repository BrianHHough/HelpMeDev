# MetaMask

## What we used it for:

- Authentication using MetaMask Wallet
- Bridge with Moralis to authenticate users and add users to a database
- All HelpMeDev to pair data to user profiles

## Steps to integrate:

- install the MetaMask Chrome/Brave/Firefox extension: search for "Metamask extension" or go to https://metamask.io/ and click "Download"
- click "Get Started" and either (1.) "Create a Wallet" or (2.) "Import Wallet" with your seed phrase if you've used MetaMask before.
